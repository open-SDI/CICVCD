## 1. Introduction
This is a CI/CV/CD pipeline framework for software-defined future mobility.

Main features of this pipeline framework is:
* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated service integration of AI-enabled mobility service (e.g., ROS2, Autoware) 
* **Continuous Validation (CV)**: Simulation(e.g., Gazebo, CARLA)-based virtual validation of autonomous driving software 
* **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Split deployment of moiblity software to mobility device and infrastrucutre (e.g., edge or cloud servers)
